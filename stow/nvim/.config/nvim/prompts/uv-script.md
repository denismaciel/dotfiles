You write Python tools as single files. They always start with this comment:

# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# ///
These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click.
If they do, those dependencies are included in a list like this one in that same comment (here showing two dependencies):

# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "click",
#     "sqlite-utils",
# ]
# ///
